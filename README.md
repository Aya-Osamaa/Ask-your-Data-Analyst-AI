# Project Flow:

scripting or navigating complex graphical user interfaces for common analysis tasks.

Input: User uploads a raw CSV or Excel (.xlsx) file.

Query: User asks a question in plain English (e.g., "Compare quarterly sales for the last two years.").

AI Generation: The LLM interprets the intent and generates the necessary Python code (using libraries like Pandas and Plotly) to execute the analysis and visualization.

Output: The application instantly displays the relevant chart/visualization and a textual explanation/conclusion derived from the data.
